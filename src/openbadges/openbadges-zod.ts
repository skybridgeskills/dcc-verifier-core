/**
 * Internal Zod shapes for OpenBadges 3.0 credential structures.
 *
 * These are the parsing primitives used by the OpenBadges submodule's
 * checks. They are intentionally **tolerant**:
 *
 * - Every field is `.optional()` and every object is `.passthrough()`.
 *   OBv3 credentials carry many spec-defined and extension fields we
 *   neither need nor want to strip or reject. Per-check logic is
 *   responsible for asserting which subset of fields it requires.
 * - `id` (and other normally-required fields) is modeled as
 *   `.string().optional()` so a single non-conforming entry inside an
 *   array (e.g. one `resultDescription` missing `id`) does not cause
 *   `safeParse` to fail the whole credential and silently skip the
 *   check. Callers filter at the point of use.
 *
 * These shapes are **not** exported from the submodule barrel in this
 * plan — they are an internal implementation detail of the checks. A
 * future P-C plan can promote them (or a curated subset) to public
 * surface if useful for consumer business logic.
 *
 * Shape coverage tracks what every check planned in the
 * 2026-04-18-openbadges-module plan needs to read:
 *
 * - `Obv3ResultShape`            — `result-ref`, `achieved-level`,
 *                                  `missing-result-status`
 * - `Obv3ResultDescriptionShape` — `result-ref`, `achieved-level`
 * - `Obv3AchievementShape`       — `result-ref`, `achieved-level`,
 *                                  `unknown-achievement-type`
 * - `Obv3CredentialSubjectShape` — top-level entry shape used by all
 *                                  checks via
 *                                  `safeParse(credential.credentialSubject)`.
 *
 * ## Why these are kept alongside the strict `Obv3p0OpenBadgeCredentialSchema`
 *
 * The 2026-04-18 P-C plan introduced a strict envelope schema in
 * `schemas/classes-v3p0.ts` and `schemas/openbadge-credential-v3p0.ts`
 * that validates an OB 3.0 credential top-to-bottom. That schema
 * powers the recognition pipeline (`obv3p0Recognizer`) and the public
 * `recognition.profile` check.
 *
 * The cross-field semantic checks below intentionally **do not**
 * adopt the strict schema for parsing. The two regimes serve
 * different purposes:
 *
 * - **Strict envelope** answers "is this a well-formed OB 3.0
 *   credential?" — a binary, top-to-bottom precondition that gates
 *   trust signals and surfaces every shape violation with an
 *   `instance` JSON Pointer.
 * - **Tolerant semantic shapes** answer "given a credential the
 *   issuer asserts is OB-shaped, do its cross-references hang
 *   together?" — a per-rule observation that should still fire when
 *   one nearby field is malformed. A `RubricCriterionLevel` missing
 *   `name` should not silence the `result-ref` check on a valid
 *   sibling.
 *
 * Refactoring these checks to consume the strict normalized form was
 * explicitly considered (see Phase 8 of the plan) and rejected: the
 * resilience gain from per-rule scoping outweighs the deduplication
 * win, and consumers who want strict envelope feedback get it from
 * the recognition pipeline directly.
