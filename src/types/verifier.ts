/**
 * Public types for the `createVerifier(...)` factory.

 * The verifier owns long-lived dependencies (HTTP, cache, crypto services,

 *
 * Hold a single `Verifier` for any batch or repeated verification work so
 * issuer DID documents, status list credentials, and JSON-LD contexts are
 * fetched once. The standalone `verifyCredential` / `verifyPresentation`
 * functions construct a fresh `Verifier` per call and are intended only
 * for one-shot use.
