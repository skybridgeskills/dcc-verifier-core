 *   that must happen first to establish the credential is what it
 *   says it is.
 * - **trust** — trust-layer evaluations like issuer / DID registry
 *   recognition (currently {@link registrySuite}; expected to grow
 *   as additional trust signals are added).
 * - **recognition** — pluggable credential recognition; produces
 *   the normalized credential form. Auto-included when `'semantic'`
 *   is requested (semantic checks may consume the normalized form).
 * - **semantic** — content-aware semantic checks (e.g. OB
 *   cross-field, future verticals).
 *
 * The canonical use case is a two-pass workflow:
 * 1. First pass with no `phases` (or `['cryptographic', 'trust']`)
 *    — full crypto verification of a presentation and its embedded
 *    credentials.
 * 2. Second pass with `phases: ['semantic']` and the
 *    profile-specific suites in `additionalSuites` — re-runs only
 *    the semantic work (recognition is auto-included).

 * The union of both passes' `results` is what a single full-phase
