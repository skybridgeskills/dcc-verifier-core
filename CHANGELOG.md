# @digitalcredentials/verifier-core CHANGELOG

## 2.0.0 -  Month XX 2026

Verifier results now fold per-suite checks into a single
`summary: SuiteSummary[]` rollup; `results[]` carries only failures
and explicit `<suite>.applies` skips by default. The full check list
remains available via `verbose: true` on the verifier or per call.

### Added

- `SuiteSummary` type and `summary: SuiteSummary[]` field on
  `CredentialVerificationResult` and `PresentationVerificationResult`.
- `id: string` field on `CheckResult` — dot-separated
  `<phase>.<suite>.<localPart>` namespace.
- `verbose?: boolean` on `VerifierConfig`, `VerifyCredentialCall`,
  `VerifyPresentationCall` (per-call wins over instance default;
  `verifyPresentation` propagates the flag to embedded credentials).
- Pure `foldCheckResults` helper and `computeId` namespace builder,
  both exported from the package barrel.
- New consumer doc at `docs/api/verification-results.md` covering the
  folded shape, the `id` namespace, a UI rendering recipe, and a
  prompt-ready appendix for downstream UIs.
- `timing?: boolean` flag on `VerifierConfig`,
  `VerifyCredentialCall`, and `VerifyPresentationCall`. When true,
  every `CheckResult`, every `SuiteSummary`, and every top-level
  `Credential|PresentationVerificationResult` carries a
  `timing: TaskTiming` field describing wall-clock start/end and
  monotonic duration. Mirrors the `verbose` flag's plumbing; per-call
  wins; propagates from `verifyPresentation` into embedded
  `verifyCredential` calls. See `docs/api/timing.md`.
- `TaskTiming` interface (`startedAt`, `endedAt`, `durationMs`,
  optional recursive `events`). The reserved `events` field is
  forward-compatible with future sub-event capture from inside a
  single check.
- `TimeService` interface plus `RealTimeService` and `FakeTimeService`
  factories. New optional `timeService` on `VerifierConfig` (defaults
  to `RealTimeService()`). Now available on
  `VerificationContext.timeService` for any future check that needs to
  ask "what time is it?" — useful groundwork for credential
  expiration, signature clock-skew, key rotation, and status-list
  freshness work.

### Changed

- **Default `results[]` shape**: failures + explicit `<suite>.applies`
  skips only. Pass `verbose: true` to restore the prior shape.
- `flattenPresentationResults` semantically unchanged; in folded mode
  the returned array is naturally smaller.

### Deprecated

- `CheckResult.check` and `CheckResult.suite` — use `CheckResult.id`
  instead. Removal target: the next major.

### Migration

- To restore the prior result shape with no other changes: pass
  `verbose: true` on the verifier or per call.
- To adopt the new shape: read `result.summary[]` for the per-suite
  rollup; read `result.results[]` for failure detail; use
  `r.id?.startsWith(summary.id + '.')` to find detail rows under a
  failing summary entry.
